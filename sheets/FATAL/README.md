F.A.T.A.L.
===============

Perhaps the most complicated character sheet submission.
This is for what is universally regarded as the most disturbing and unnecessary roleplaying systems.
There are some quick link checkboxes for displaying each of the many pages for the charsheet at the top, below the quick-reference stats.
If anyone finds themself using this sheet, for the love of God, get some help.
