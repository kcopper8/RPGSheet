- Lay out and color scheme based on in put from 20 users.
- Run through the gauntlet as every field, button and input was tested during game play in multiple groups with varying player bases.
- Intended to be a standard vanilla template using the same game terms and references as presented in the D&D Next play test packet. Used the D&D Next character sheet presented in the play test packet as a reference for this design.

- I expect to be making no further revisions to this sheet until the next edition of D&D is published this summer.
