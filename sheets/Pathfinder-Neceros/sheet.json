    "instructions": "# Character Sheet\r Inspired by Actoba's D&D 5E sheet. This sheet auto-calculates many fields, including, but not limited to, Ability scores & mods, Skills, HP, and Saves using the rules as written.\r\r## Attributes\r\r* You can mouse over any field to get its attribute name.\r* All field titles follow Roll20's attribute syntax, ie. AC would be displayed as \"@{AC}\" on mouse-over.\r\r## Rolls\r* You can mouse over any button to get its ability name.\r* Roll button titles follow Roll20's ability syntax, using the selected token, ie. \"%{selected|STR-check}\".\r\r## Using the stat block\r* NPC Stat Block coming soon.\r\r## Additional Notes\r* HP|max uses the formula within HP Formula to calculate your total HP. The default formula is \"total HP gained from each class + (CON * level)\"\r* The Initiative button adds your token to the initiative tracker, and therefore requires you to have a token selected to work. It also adds your initiative modifier as a decimal for the purposes of tie-breaking and ease of sorting.\r* The CS column in the skills table denotes class skills and automatically adds 3 when you put a rank in it.\r* If there's something you want added, or you'd like to report a bug, please contact the Sam in the \"Pathfinder sheet thread 2: Golarion boogaloo\" thread in the \"Character Sheets\" forum.\r\r## Special Thanks\r\r* I'd like to thank the following for their help in the development of this sheet.\r* Actoba\r* Phnord Prefect\r* Vince\r* Everyone in the character sheet test game"
