# Microlite20 Character Sheet

This is a Microlite20 character sheet.  It is designed for
use with Roll20.net and released open source under the MIT License.

### Changelog ###

**Release 3**

- Flipped the order of female and male sexes... Not making a sexist
statement here, but the default option should be the more common option.
- Removed Spells functionality.  Microlite's rule is you can cast any
spell your level allows, and no player wants to painstakingly add every
single spell to their character sheet.  
- Added buttons for attack rolls.  These rolls also incorporate the
fighter class's additional +1 (per 5 levels) paradigm.  These new
buttons appear beside the attack bonus section.
- Modified skill check buttons.  They now incorporate the human class
logic of an automatic +1 when human is selected as the race.
- Added descriptions to the rolls to explain, in chat, what they are, and
how they were calculated.
- Added an Armor section to define your armor and the armor class bonus
- Removed old Armor Bonus section in favor of new Armor section
- Modified Weapons section to include the fighter bonus to the damage
rolls, if fighter is selected.
- Added Save Rolls
- Added weapon range type to weapon section
- Added Strength Bonus to damage rolls
- Added level modifier to attack rolls
- Modified Missile Attack Rolls to include light weapons.


**Release 2**
- Fixed a bug with Armor Class, and added buttons for skill rolls.

**Initial release - August 12, 2014**
- First release.  As we playtest with a campaign I expect all the kinks will get
worked out. Look for updates within the next two months.
