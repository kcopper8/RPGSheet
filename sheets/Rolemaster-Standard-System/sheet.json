	"instructions": "To help reduce lag, this sheet has very few calculations; most fields must be entered manually.  It still may take several seconds to load due to the sheer number of skills.  Space provided to add custom skills or other skills at the bottom of the skill tab.  Includes a tab for NPC/Monsters with space for all fields from Creatures & Monsters.  Should also work for RMFRP."
