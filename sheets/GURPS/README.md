In progress character sheet for the Generic Universal Roleplaying System.

Styling is inspired primarily by GCS, but also with some influence from the official sheet. The goal was to design a reponsive character sheet that would look good even with a small screen width.


TODO
 - Implement auto-calc for the point summary (if possible).
 - Automatic encumberance calculation, or at least highlighting.
 - Automatic stat reduction at low HP/FP
