	"instructions": "The roll buttons assume you have two rollable tables, one named `exalted` and one named `exalted-damage`.\n\nThe table `exalted` should have the following table items:\n\n* \"botch\" (weight 1)\n* \"0\" (weight 5)\n* \"1\" (weight 3)\n* \"2\" (weight 1)\n\nThe table `exalted-damage` should have the following table items:\n\n* \"0\" (weight 6)\n* \"1\" (weight 4)\n\nIf your campaign includes Sidereals throwing around Ascending and/or Descending Destinies, you will either need the API (a mentor feature) or alternate rollable tables, and the roll buttons on the sheet will not be correct.\n\n**When creating your own macros,** be sure to multiply any Ability by `1-Ability|max`, to account for abilities which have been reset to 0. For example, `/r (@{Dexterity}+@{Melee})t[exalted]` will roll your Dexterity and Melee together, however if the checkbox to reset Melee to 0 is ticked, the roll will be incorrect. Instead, use `/r (@{Dexterity+@{Melee}*(1-@{Melee|max}))t[exalted]`."
