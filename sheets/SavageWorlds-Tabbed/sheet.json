   "instructions": "# Character Sheet\rInspired by Actoba's D&D 5E sheet and herrozerro's Savage Worlds sheet (with a special mention to Sam Marino for a spiffy json file).\r\r## Configuration\r\rIn the configuration section you can:\r\r* **UI Tweaks**\r\r  * Elect to show dice icons instead of drop down menus.\r    - This feature is only available for Attributes, Skills, and the Wild Die.\r    - It is not available in the Repeating Sections (though I hope to make it available in the future).\r    - The dice are color coded: d4=Red, d6 & d8=black, d10=blue, d12=green.\r    - The enhanced Trait Die Type Drop Down Menu uses the same field names as the regular drop downs, which introduces a risk for potential data loss. To minimize risk use only the standard textual drop down menu OR make periodic notations of all Trait ranks.\r      + **NOTE:** I've not experienced any problems (except with repeating sections, which is why this hasn't been implemented there yet. But, fair warning.\r  * Quest Font Type allows you to choose a handwriting font for the Quest Log section of the character sheet. To select a font, hover over the selection to the right of the Quest Font Type\r* **Game Setting Configuration**\r  * Additional Game Settings\r    - You can choose to add various fields to your character sheet to match your settings.  Settings supported so far include:\r      + The Last Parsec\r     + Pirates of the Spanish Main\r     + Tour of Darkness (and other horrific settings)\r     + Necessary Evil (and other Supers settings)\r     + Deadlands\r  - Additional settings and fields will be added as opportunity and demand allows. I hope to incorporate as many different Savage Worlds Settings as possible.\r* Backgrounds\r  - Choose a background image for your character sheet. Current available backgrounds include:\r    + Blank white sheet\r    + Old Map on Parchment\r    + Zombiepacalypse\r  - Additional backgrounds will be added as opportunity and demand allows.\r* Logos\r  - Choose a logo for your character sheet. Current available logos include:\r    + Savage Worlds Deluxe\r    + Savage Worlds Deluxe (Bloodied)\r    + The Last Parsec\r    + Pirates of the Spanish Main\r  - Additional logos will be added as opportunity and demand allows.\r* Skills (Wild Card and Mook)\r  - All skills from the Savage Worlds Core Deluxe rules are included in the sheet, but are hidden by default. To have them appear in your character sheet, click on the Configuration button in the upper left-hand corner and place a check mark next to each skill you'd like to use.\r* All Trait dice are limited to the standard d4-d12 dice. To accomodate certain Edges that allow one to have a trait die type that has a permanent modifier (ie Professional, Woodsman, etc.) use the modifier box to the right of each Trait die type.\r* Unless explicitly noted in the Configuration Element, all Configurations apply only to the Wild Card sheet.\r\r## Attributes & Skills\r\r* You can mouse over just about any field to get its attribute name.\r* All field titles follow Roll20's attribute syntax, ie. Agility would be displayed as \"@{agility}\" on mouse-over.\r\r## The Wild Die\r\r* The Wild Die is a configurable field to allow for Edges (such as Master) that may alter the Wild Die.\r\r## Rolls\r\r* You can mouse over any button to get its ability name.\r* Roll button titles DO NOT follow Roll20's ability syntax, using the selected token, ie. \"%{selected|STR-check}\", but will only show the attribute displayed like \"@{AgilityRoll}\".\r* The gm button uses the exact same formula for rolling as the regular button, but will whisper the roll to the GM.\r\r## Character Sheet\r\r* The Character Sheet view can be toggled between Wild Card and Mook using the button in the upper left-hand corner (default is Wild Card)\r* The Mook sheet is a stripped down version of the Wild Card sheet and does not roll a Wild Die for Trait Rolls.\r\r## Additional Notes\r\r* Most Repeating Sections have a \"Hide Macro Formula\" checkbox. Unchecking it will review a the formula to be used to create macros that simulate the roll buttons in repeating sections.\r* Apply Encumbrance Checkbox (in the skills sections) can be checked to automatically apply any Encumbrance Penalties to a particular skill roll. The standard skills already care for this automatically.\r* If there's something you want added, or you'd like to report a bug, please contact the G V. in the \"Character Sheets\" forum (putting Savage Worlds in the title will help me notice the post more readily, but isn't strictly necessary).\r\r## Special Thanks\r\rI'd like to thank the following for their help in the development of this sheet:\r\r* Shane Hensley (for giving permission to use all the Savage Worlds Settings Logos)\r\r\r---\r\r* Actoba\r* herrozerro\r* Brian (CSS wizard)\r\rI stole a lot of css/html from them\r\r* Everyone in the character sheet forum"
