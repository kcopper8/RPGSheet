### Development Tools

This sheet uses Grunt to make development more easy.

If you haven’t used Grunt before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started
guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

#### Developing the Sheet

To make changes to the sheet and test things out use

```bash
grunt
```

Then open [`testbed/index.html`](testbed/index.html) in your browser to preview the sheet.

You can also use

```bash
grunt serve
```

Then open [http://localhost:9001/testbed/](http://localhost:9001/testbed/) in your browser to preview the sheet. With LiveReload integration, the view in your browser is updated, whenever you save the html or css file.


#### Releasing the Sheet

When you’re ready to use the sheet in Roll20 then use

```bash
grunt build
```

This will create `13th_Age-neovatar.[css|html]` that you can copy and paste into Roll 20 directly.
